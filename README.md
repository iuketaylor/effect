# Effect Spike

This repository contains experiments and explorations with [Effect](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect), a powerful TypeScript library for building robust applications with functional programming principles.

## What is Effect?

Effect is a TypeScript library that provides:
- **Error Handling**: Type-safe error management without exceptions
- **Dependency Injection**: Elegant service management and testing
- **Concurrency**: Structured concurrency with fibers
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of resources
- **Observability**: Built-in metrics, tracing, and logging
- **Functional Programming**: Immutable data structures and pure functions

## TLDR

**Effect** is a TypeScript library that brings functional programming patterns to TypeScript, offering type-safe error handling, dependency injection, and structured concurrency. It's particularly strong for complex business logic and service architectures but comes with a learning curve and some performance overhead.

**Good for**: APIs with complex error scenarios, data pipelines, background jobs, highly testable services  
**Not ideal for**: Simple scripts, performance-critical hot paths, legacy Promise-heavy codebases

**Key Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Excellent type safety and composability
- ✅ Built-in dependency injection and testing utilities
- ❌ Steeper learning curve (functional programming concepts)
